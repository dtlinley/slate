	<h3>What I've Done</h3>

	<p>Various things. I went to school, for instance; I graduated from the University of Waterloo's Computer Science Co-operative Education program (UW CS co-op). I've worked all over the world (or at least all around it-- from Perth, Australia to Toronto, Canada). I've made software, made more software, done some singing and camping, and made more software. Besides making software for companies, I've started a few side projects to keep myself busy.</p>

	<h3>Where I've Worked</h3>

	<h4>Xtreme Labs</h4>

	<p><a href="http://www.xtremelabs.com/">Xtreme Labs</a> is a mobile application development shop set up in downtown Toronto. With an emphasis on pair programming and transparent agile methodologies, Xtreme works closely with various clients large and small to develop mobile applications across all platforms. My work there so far has focused on iOS development, but Android, BlackBerry (7 and 10), Windows Phone and Windows 8 apps are all done in-house at Xtreme. Our clients include Cineplex, CIBC, MEC, MTV and <a href="http://www.xtremelabs.com/clients">various other well known brands</a>. Pair programming provides great learning opportunities for new hires and allows the company to grow quickly while sticking to its core practices and values. 

	<h4>DownUnder GeoSolutions</h4>

	<p>Located in beautiful Perth, Australia, <a href="http://www.dugeo.com/">DownUnder GeoSolutions</a> is a leading geosciences consulting and software development company. The Insight software package is developed in-house, used internally for hired consulting work and licensed to other firms that perform geo-analytical work of their own. Insight handles geological data manipulation and visualisation to facilitate a variety of tasks, chiefly involving finding underground or under-sea pockets of hydrocarbons (oil and gas) to be drilled. Built in Java with modified Swing UI elements, Insight is a very powerful piece of software that is continuously being updated and upgraded by a skilled team of developers. I was fortunate enough to spend an eight month co-op term in Perth, learning a huge amount about creating large maintainable projects, properly integrating changes from a team of developers and effective team management. With weekly internal software releases, it was easy to get feedback on the usefulness and correctness of new features.</p>

	<h4>Sybase</h4>	

	<p><a href="http://www.sybase.com/">Sybase</a> is a worldwide powerhouse in database development, with a large team spread out over the world all working together to enrich the Sybase brand of products. Acquired by SAP in 2010, Sybase has the backing of a large international company while still retaining its independence. I was hired as an intern at Sybase's Waterloo office twice as part of the IQ database team, working with departments in several continents worldwide. Developed in C++, the IQ database system is used by thousands of customers internationally and being able to develop features for the system was an excellent way to have real impact on a large project. Sybase provides a great example of how to split a very large engineering force into manageable teams that can work on many projects simultaneously without sacrificing communication within the company.</p>

	<h3>What I'm Good At</h3>

	<p>I excel at working as part of a small dedicated team; my ideal environment is one in which I can work mostly uninterrupted on features and bugs, but where I can also collaborate with my colleagues whenever necessary. I always try to get other opinions when I'm making large architectural decisions, and I always appreciate help if I am stuck or blocked on an issue. I have about 7 years of experience developing applications in Java, and it follows that I have a solid grasp of Object Oriented principles, software architecture standards and design patterns. I make informed suggestions about architecture and implementation choices, and I'm not afraid to take part in discussions. I've used git extensively, I've taught git to my friends and coworkers, and have an intimate knowledge of the inner workings of my fetch-rebase workflow. It must also be said that I'm pretty terrible at modesty.</p>

	<h3>Technologies I Like</h3>

	<p>At home I run <a href="http://elementaryos.org/">Elementary OS</a>, an Ubuntu-based GNU/Linux distribution-- I've been running various (mostly Debian-based) flavours of Linux since 2006. Having used Java for 7 years, it has become my preferred programming language. Eclipse is my go-to IDE for now; I appreciate the ability to auto-format code on save, and the built-in debugger does well enough for most of my needs.</p>
