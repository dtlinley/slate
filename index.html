       <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
        <p>I am David Linley, a Professional and a Software Developer living and working in Toronto, Ontario. </p>

	<h3>What have I done?</h3>

        <p>Various things. I went to school, for instance; I graduated from the University of Waterloo's Computer Science Co-operative Education program (UW CS co-op). I've worked all over the world (or at least all around it-- from Perth, Australia to Toronto, Canada). I've made software, made more software, done some singing and camping, and made more software. Besides making software for companies, I've started a few side projects to keep myself busy.</p>
